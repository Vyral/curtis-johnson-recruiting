Today we want to address a question we get quite frequently. **People have started to take notice that the team structure in real estate has made real estate business more profitable than they ever have been.** Working in real estate as a team is not a new idea, but where do those who want to start their own team begin? We are here today to answer that question.

**Like many things in real estate, people that give advice are usually just spectators.** I started building my team 15 years ago and I have seen pretty much everything in the process of selling over 3000 homes.

I started my team like most people, realizing that I had too much on my plate before hiring a buyer specialist to help out. We grew our team through trial and error, and there are a ton of things we wish we would have known beforehand about the business. Here are the two most important takeaways:

**1. Make sure you want a team**
 Don't just start a team because somebody tells you to do it, make sure you want a team working with you to sell homes. Although the team structure can be lucrative, it's not for everyone and definitely not the only way to make money in real estate.

**2. Don't hire before your systems are ready**
 Simply hiring someone won't do any good. You need to have good systems in place for training new employees and bringing them up to speed, **so the people you hire can follow it and you can multiply and scale your business.**

Hopefully these tips will help you in your journey. If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call or send us a quick email. We are always here to help!
