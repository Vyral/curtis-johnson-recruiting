Looking to improve your real estate career? I'm here to help you make a smart decision when it comes to growing your business, improving your bottom line, and choosing a place to work in real estate sales.

Real estate agents change brokerages for many reasons, but one reason we see a lot is that a brokerage just didn't provide enough training for them.

We pride ourselves on the fact that we train essentially every day of the week. On Mondays and Fridays we have a team huddle, and then Tuesday is our big team meeting. On Wednesdays and Thursdays we focus on training our agents with their scripts or how to win a listing, etc.

We cover such a large area here in the Valley that we put our training up online for you to access anywhere, at anytime. **We believe that training is the key to raising your income, because you are your biggest asset.**

I'm part of some different groups that discuss new strategies, and I personally run 90% of the training sessions that we have here. **Sometimes I'll bring in another top producer from around the country to share ideas, and we will also occasionally host a mini-mastermind group.**

If you have any questions about our training program or about our brokerage in general, please be sure to reach out to me. I'm always willing to assist you!
