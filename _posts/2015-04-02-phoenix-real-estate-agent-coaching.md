Looking to improve your real estate career? I'm here to help you make a smart decision when it comes to growing your business, improving your bottom line, and choosing a place to work in real estate sales.

Hello, and welcome back to our coaching blog! Today, we discuss **the importance of maintaining a presence online if you want to grow your business.**

Years ago, the internet was basically a glorified Rolodex for real estate agents. TV and radio were the biggest marketing tools, and it was somewhat easy to track how well they were working. **Now, just about everyone starts their search online - whether it's for a car, a new watch, or a home.** If your product isn't found when someone searches for it online, you're out of the discussion!  

Not only is it important to be found - **it's also important to dominate the search engines.** Both your branded and unbranded information needs to be easily accessible online if you want to attract both new business and repeat business.

One of the benefits of being on a team is the time you have to focus on dollar-producing activities. Sitting around messing with your Facebook page or changing the font for an online ad is not going to result in sales. So you need to ask yourself: **what are you doing to drive business in?** Our team spends a lot of money to build a website for each member of our team in order to drive leads to them. **This helps them convert leads at the highest possible level.**

Staying visible online is a very competitive endeavor. Do a search for yourself and see what you find. Do you like what you see? If not, now's not the time to try to become a web master. **On our team, we take care of the web presence so that our agents can focus on what they do best.** The web is an ever-changing landscape, and there just isn't enough time to juggle being a diligent agent and a web guru; that's why we take that part of the business off our agents' plates.

If you want to expose your clients' homes to the most amount of people, **you need to syndicate your listings with various websites.** We're very aggressive about this - we have virtual tours, HD tours, 3D tours, and drone videos. **The goal is to stand out, be different, and make our content easy to find online.** You either do this yourself or you pay for someone to do it for you. One of the benefits of being part of a large team is that they are able to handle that aspect of the business for you.

If you have any questions about maintaining an online presence without sacrificing time and energy that would be better spent with clients, give us a call or shoot us a quick email. We would love to help you grow your business and succeed in real estate!
