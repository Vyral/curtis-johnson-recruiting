**When we’re talking about houses, one strategy that has given us an advantage is WISGAT.** Instead of someone calling us up and asking about a home’s price and us giving a simple answer, we talk about WISGAT instead.

WISGAT stands for “What Is So Great About That” and I actually picked up this technique from the Home Shopping Network. **Instead of just saying something is a vacuum cleaner, they talk about what it does and how it will change your life.**

So instead of just saying a home has four bedrooms and three bathrooms, we say it has four bedrooms with one being a home office that can save time, save money, and give convenience. Instead of just saying a home has a pool, it has a place that you can use to entertain. Instead of saying what something is, we say what’s so great about it.

**I challenge you to use this strategy next time someone calls you up.** Instead of talking about what a home has, talk about why what it has is so great and beneficial to the person who is looking.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
