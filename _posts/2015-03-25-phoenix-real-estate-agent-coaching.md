Looking to improve your real estate career? I'm here to help you make a smart decision when it comes to growing your business, improving your bottom line, and choosing a place to work in real estate sales. If you'd like to learn more about working with Curtis Johnson Realty, contact me at 480-355-4055 or email career@curtisjohnsonrealty.com

Hello, and welcome to the Curtis Johnston Realty coaching blog!

We're going to be coming to you via video every few weeks to **give you tips and tricks to help you grow your business!** If we cover something here that you find interesting, don't hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email. If you want to take an even deeper look at a topic, we highly suggest setting up a strategy session with our team!

Many agents approach us and ask whether they should work with buyers or sellers. To answer that question, the first thing you need to do is ask yourself what outcome you're looking for. After all, **the more specific the outcome you strive for, the more specific your path needs to be.** It's much easier to break into the industry on the buyer's side because you can often out-friend even top producers. **Buyers are looking to buy a home, and sellers are looking for an agent with the right marketing strategy.** If you don't have a large budget or much of a track record, your best bet is to start on the buyer side of things until you start producing at a high level.

Our team is one of the few that helps people specialize in the area that's best for them. Some people gravitate toward sellers, while others gravitate more toward buyers; some people are able to do both. **It all has to do with the personality profile of the person in question.** Our system allows for multiple avenues of success for our agents, while most other teams will force you to start on the buyer side.

If this topic interests you, or if you're wondering what your personality profile is, give us a call or shoot us a quick email. We would love to hear from you!
