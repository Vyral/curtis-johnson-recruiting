Welcome to my new real estate coaching blog! My goal is to help you to grow your business and reach new levels of success within this industry. If you find something interesting, or have questions about anything discussed here, then please feel free to contact me and to use me as a resource.

**How often should you reach out to past clients?**
People begin to forget about you 21 days after you speak to them. So, ideally, you should reach out to them about every three weeks with a quick email, text, or phone call. Forming a system to do this is important, and will likely determine your success or failure within this aspect of the business. You don't need to contact them just about real estate, it can be casual, but just make sure they know that you're still there.

**How much business should come from repeats and referrals?**
Most agents can't market to new businesses because they're flushed for cash, so in the real world about 80-90% of an agent's business would be coming from repeats and referrals. Ideally, 40-50% of my business would come from this so I could grow my base of clients, but with growing companies it's important to utilize referrals and repeat customers.

**Will working with an established team help an agent gain new business?**
I was 26 when I entered this business and I really didn't have a lot of value, but when you join an established business you can automatically get a lot of experience. Overall, if you're starting out in this industry, you need to find something that gives you immediate credibility. People need to trust you, so working with an established team is very helpful within this aspect.

Hopefully this has been valuable to you, and if you have any further questions, please be sure to contact me and I would be more than glad to help you out.
