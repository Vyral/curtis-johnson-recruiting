Why do I have a drill bit in my hand? Let me explain.

**If struggling agents were going to try to sell a drill bit, they would explain its setup**—what type of metal it’s made of, etc.

Now, high-producing agents would talk about the hole—nobody really wants a drill bit. These agents will **sell the product based on what it can do or produce.**

Super high-producing agents, on the other had, won’t just talk about the drill bit and what makes it special. **They’ll paint a picture with its possibilities** and sell it based on its utilities, like hanging up a clock or a family portrait.

Now, of course real estate agents aren’t selling drill bits, but the lesson here also applies to selling homes. **A truly skilled agent won't just talk about the home’s construction or layout, but rather highlight how it will change your life.** My point is that you need to be creative and illustrate the full potential of a home in order to maximize and scale your business.

If you have any questions about real estate, I’d be happy to speak with you. Reach out to the Curtis Johnson Team any time.
