Thanks for joining us once again. Today we'd like to share with you a question we get quite frequently from agents who are just starting out. Everybody wants to make it in this business, so **people keep asking me, "What activities should I be doing to guarantee success?"**

{% include pullquote.html %}

Being a solo agent in the real estate business can be frustrating. We see a lot of value in working in a team environment where you can specialize in one area, but that's not for everybody. **Success leaves clues, and we've tracked millions of agents from across the country and boiled their success down to a few key metrics that you can learn a lot from.**

One of the best activities you can do to ensure success is practicing the "10-2-1" method in your business each week. **This means you are asking for 10 appointments, do 2 home tours with 2 different buyers, and attend 1 listing presentation per week.** Sticking to this plan and doing it each week will give you the life that others envy.

Thanks for taking the time to check out our blog. If you want to align your natural ability to your preferences and make more money selling real estate, reach out to us. We'd be glad to help you out.
